1) Detonator is created (from prefab)
2) Fills with default materials if none are assigned pre-runtime
3) Adds components if there are none (and auto is on) and then calls Reset()
4) Reset() fills compnent with materials and sets defaults
5) When Explode() is called, UpdateComponents() is called first
6) Calls Init() for each component 
7) Init() then builds all the componets as gameObjects and places them as a child on the Detonator prefab
