# Detonator
The Detonator Explosion Framework makes it easy to incorporate high quality explosions into your games. It is a system that abstracts the different parts of an explosion and lets you tweak each of them independently.

The package includes prefabs that can be instantiated as well as a system for creating and modifying your own explosions. Easily change the color, size, and detail of your explosions, even at runtime. Use the supplied textures and sounds or replace with your own.

2.0 Release (Sept 2019)

- Updated Detonator to use Shuriken on Unity 2017 and above
- Included prefabs you have used from previous Detonator versions now call Shuriken instead of legacy particle system
